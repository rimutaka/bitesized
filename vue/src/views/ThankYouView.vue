    <h3>Thank you for your generous support</h3>
    <p>Questions are a great way to identify gaps in knowledge.</p>
    <p>Answers with detailed explanations are an easy way to fill those gaps.</p>
    <p>Learning through questions is not a substitute for other types of learning or practicing a skill,
      but doing it consistently adds up.</p>
