Which two CloudFront policies affect CORS configuration?

# Caching policy
Incorrect.
This policy defines what is being cached and how.
It does not affect CORS headers.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html#managed-cache-caching-optimized

# Origin request policy
Correct.
This policy defines what headers are passed from the caller to the origin.
Then the origin can decide if the calls is allowed under its CORS rules.

If the CORS headers are generated by the origin, the policy must allow the following headers to be passed from the caller to the Origin:
- Origin
- Access-Control-Request-Headers
- Access-Control-Request-Method

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html

# Response headers policy
Correct.
This policy defines the CORS headers returned by CloudFront.
E.g. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to allow CORS requests from any domain.
